            <h2>Research Interest</h2>
            <p>I am a researcher interested in questions in cosmology and gravitational physics. I enjoy using computational and analytical methods to solve the questions. I have worked on research projects related to generalized dark matter and neutron-star equations of state. I am also interested in the cosmological perturbation theory and cosmic microwave background.</p>

            <h3>Uncertainty Quantification for the Relativistic Inverse Stellar Structure Problem</h3>
            <p>University of California, San Diego | PI: Dr. Lee Lindblom | Jul 2024 - Oct 2024</p>
            <p>Abstract: The relativistic inverse stellar structure problem determines the equation of state of the stellar matter given a knowledge of suitable macroscopic observable properties (e.g. their masses and radii) of the stars composed of that material. This study determines how accurately this equation of state can be determined using noisy mass and radius observations. The relationship between the size of the observational errors and the accuracy of the inferred equation of state is evaluated, and the optimal number of adjustable equation of state parameters needed to achieve the highest accuracy is determined.</p>

            <h3>Chebyshev Based Spectral Representations of Neutron-Star Equations of State</h3>
            <p>University of California, San Diego | PI: Dr. Lee Lindblom | Jun 2024 - Aug 2024</p>
            <p>Abstract: Causal parametric representations of neutron-star equations of state are constructed here using Chebyshev polynomial based spectral expansions. The accuracies of these representations are evaluated for a collection of model equations of state from a variety of nuclear-theory models and also a collection of equations of state with first- or second-order phase transitions of various sizes. These tests show that the Chebyshev based representations are convergent (even for equations of state with phase transitions) as the number of spectral basis functions is increased. This study finds that the Chebyshev based representations are generally more accurate than a previously studied power-law based spectral representation, and that pressure-based representations are generally more accurate than those based on enthalpy.</p>
